# Programming for Everybody - Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my learning journey through the **"Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)"** course offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The course is designed for beginners in programming, and I’m using this repository to document my progress, store my initial Python codes, and track my understanding of core programming concepts.

## About the Course

- **Course Name**: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
- **Instructor**: Dr. Charles Severance
- **Platform**: Coursera
- **Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of Python programming with no prior experience required. The course covers topics such as variables, expressions, loops, functions, and more.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by modules and examples covered in the course. Each folder contains scripts and exercises that correspond to specific concepts or tasks:

```
.
├── module-1
│   ├── example-1
│   │   └── hello.py
│   └── example-2
│       ├── big-word-count.py
│       └── words.txt
```

## Goals

The goal of this project is to:
1. Document my learning progress.
2. Keep track of my early code solutions and improvements over time.
3. Review and reflect on the concepts learned for future reference.

## How to Use This Repository

You can explore the different module folders to see the Python scripts I've worked on. Each folder contains scripts and comments explaining the purpose and logic of the code.
