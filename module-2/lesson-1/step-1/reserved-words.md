# Reserved Words in Python

## What are Reserved Words?

Reserved words, also known as keywords, are predefined words in Python that have specific meanings and purposes. These words cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier because they are reserved by the language for specific syntax or functionality.

Below is a list of all reserved words in Python, along with a brief description of what each word does.

## Python Reserved Words List

| Keyword      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `False`      | Boolean value representing false. |
| `None`       | Represents the absence of a value or a null value. |
| `True`       | Boolean value representing true. |
| `and`        | Logical AND operator. |
| `as`         | Used to create an alias when importing a module. |
| `assert`     | Used for debugging purposes to test conditions. |
| `async`      | Declares an asynchronous function or coroutine. |
| `await`      | Used to wait for the result of an asynchronous operation. |
| `break`      | Terminates a loop prematurely. |
| `class`      | Used to define a class. |
| `continue`   | Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next. |
| `def`        | Used to define a function or method. |
| `del`        | Deletes objects, such as variables or list elements. |
| `elif`       | Used in conditional statements, equivalent to "else if". |
| `else`       | Specifies what to do if the condition in an `if` statement is false. |
| `except`     | Catches exceptions in a try-except block. |
| `finally`    | Executes code after a try-except block, regardless of the outcome. |
| `for`        | Used for looping over an iterable. |
| `from`       | Used to import specific parts of a module. |
| `global`     | Declares that a variable inside a function refers to a globally scoped variable. |
| `if`         | Starts a conditional statement. |
| `import`     | Imports modules or specific parts of modules into the current namespace. |
| `in`         | Tests whether a value exists in a sequence or iterable. |
| `is`         | Tests for object identity, checks if two variables point to the same object. |
| `lambda`     | Creates an anonymous function. |
| `nonlocal`   | Declares that a variable refers to a previously bound variable in an outer function. |
| `not`        | Logical NOT operator. |
| `or`         | Logical OR operator. |
| `pass`       | A null statement; used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed. |
| `raise`      | Raises an exception. |
| `return`     | Exits a function and optionally returns a value. |
| `try`        | Specifies a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. |
| `while`      | Creates a while loop, which continues as long as a condition is true. |
| `with`       | Simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks. |
| `yield`      | Pauses a function and returns an intermediate result, resuming when called again. |

These reserved words are fundamental building blocks of Python's syntax and must be used correctly to ensure that the code works as intended.
